## GitHub Workflow

### Continuous Integration (CI) Workflow

- The CI workflow is triggered on every push to the main branch.
- It checks code quality, runs tests, and deploys to staging.

```yaml
name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: 14

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install

      - name: Run linting and tests
        run: npm test

      - name: Deploy to staging
        run: |
          # Add deployment steps here
          echo "Deploying to staging..."
```

### Release Workflow

- The Release workflow is triggered on the creation of a new release.
- It builds and packages the application, creates a release artifact, and uploads it to GitHub releases.

```yaml
name: Release

on:
  release:
    types:
      - created

jobs:
  release:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: 14

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install

      - name: Build and package
        run: npm run build

      - name: Create release artifact
        run: tar -czvf release.tar.gz dist/

      - name: Upload artifact to GitHub releases
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v2
        with:
          name: release-artifact
